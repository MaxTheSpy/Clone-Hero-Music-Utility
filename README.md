Help:
This script organizes folders into a structure based on band names and song names.

Folder Setup:
1. Your music folder should contain subfolders named in the format 'Band - Song Name'.
2. For example, if you have a band named 'The Great Band' and a song named 'Hit Single',
   you should have a folder named 'The Great Band - Hit Single'.

How the Script Works:
1. The script will iterate through each folder in the specified music folder.
2. It will split the folder names based on ' - ' to determine the band name and song name.
3. It will create a new folder for each band if it doesn't already exist.
4. The script will move each song folder into the corresponding band folder.
5. If a folder with the same name already exists, you will be given options to:
   - Overwrite the existing folder
   - Skip moving the folder
   - Delete the existing folder

Options:
1. Sort songs into band folders: Organizes your folders as described.
2. Fix Bad Songs: Handles issues listed in pasted content.
3. Exit: Closes the script.
